# Flappy Bird Game

> Flappy Bird 2D Game with using JavaScript and Canvas

**Stack:** HTML, JavaScript

**Main functionality:**

- click any button on your keyboard you like to make the bird move up;
- if the bird faces any pipes or the ground the game is over and you should start again;
- the aim of the game is to help the bird fly through the gap between the pipes;
- for each flight through the gap you get points (they are shown below).

**My record is 31 points. Try to beat it!**
